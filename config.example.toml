# Hardware Tester Configuration File
# ==================================
# Copy this file to config.toml and modify as needed.

# Relay Board Configuration
[relay]
port = "COM3"  # Windows: COM3, COM4, etc. | Linux: /dev/ttyUSB0, etc.

# DUT Serial Port Configuration
[dut]
# Simple format - list of port names (uses default 115200 baud):
# ports = ["COM4", "COM5"]

# Detailed format - per-port configuration:
ports = [
    { port = "COM4", baud_rate = 115200, name = "main_uart" },
    { port = "COM5", baud_rate = 9600, name = "debug_uart" },
]

# Logging Configuration
[logging]
directory = "./logs"        # Log file output directory
timestamp_lines = true      # Prepend timestamp to each logged line

# Sequence Configuration (for file mode: hwtester -c config.toml -f)
[sequence]
# Can be a single comma-separated string:
# commands = "R1:ON,D500,R2:ON,D1000,R1:OFF,R2:OFF"

# Or an array for better readability:
commands = [
    "R1:ON",      # Power on DUT
    "D2000",      # Wait 2 seconds for boot
    "R2:ON",      # Enable test signal
    "D5000",      # Run test for 5 seconds
    "R2:OFF",     # Disable test signal
    "D500",       # Brief delay
    "R1:OFF",     # Power off DUT
]

# Command Reference:
# ------------------
# R<n>:ON   - Turn relay n on (n = 0-15)
# R<n>:OFF  - Turn relay n off (n = 0-15)
# D<ms>     - Delay for specified milliseconds
#
# Examples:
#   R0:ON    - Turn on relay 0
#   R15:OFF  - Turn off relay 15
#   D1000    - Wait 1 second
